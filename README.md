# SHAPEAI PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days free bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI. The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI. 
<br><br> here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well <br>

<br> I got to have hands on experience on: 
<li> python
<li>Machine Learning
<li> Tensorflow
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from very basics so that 
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well . To regester for next 7 days bootcamp, visit:
